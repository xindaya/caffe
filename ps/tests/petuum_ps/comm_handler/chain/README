This simple experiment is to answer the following questions:

1) when a router socket is bind()ed (and has accepted some connection), can it 
still connect to some other socket?

2) If it can, is the established connection broken?

3) When a bind()ed socket successfully connects to some other socket, can it 
stll receive incoming connections?

It turns out the answers are:
1) Yes
2) No
3) Yes

To run the experiemnt, do the following (assuming in ../comm_zmq/):

STEP 1:
     Create all executables:

     make chain-server
     make chain-bridge
     make chain-client

STEP 2:
     Run the root server, this is the same as test/server.cpp. It starts and 
     waits for n (default n = 1) clients to connect.
     ./bin/chain/server     

     Run serclient. It creates a socket waiting for n - 1 (default n = 2) 
     clients to connect:
     ./bin/chain/bridge --id 1 --ncli 2

     Run the first client, it is the same as test/client.cpp (with some default 
     options changed):
     ./bin/chain/client --id 2

     You should see the client (id2) is connected to bridge and it receives a 
     msg from serclient.
     Once receives the connection, bridge connects to server -- answers 
     question 1): yes.
     The server will send a message to bridge, and it is received 
     successfully -- answers questions 2): no, the established connection is 
     still alive.
     
     The bridge then waits for another connection from client.

     Run the second client,
     ./bin/chain/client --id 3
     
     The client connects to bridge, and receives a msg from bridge -- answers 
     question 3): yes.
     Bridge waits for the two clients responses. When it receives the response, 
     it responds to root server. They all shuts down properly.
